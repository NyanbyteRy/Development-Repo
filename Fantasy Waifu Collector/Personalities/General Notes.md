I am working on rebuilding the personalities of the characters the Player collects
  As per NDA, I will not be able to share the code I'm using to collect this data as it came from SyKoHPaTH

The personalities break down into a 6x5 grid, as one per Nature/Role combo was requested.

So the process I went through was to read the previous dialogue code that was send to me.
Then, I broke that down into the core parts of the personality. However, this runs into an issue on the micro scale where the traits from the Role and Nature are combined.
This required that I break everything down into its core parts and then group them into respective groups.
  I.e. grouping all of one nature into a group, ignoring role, and the inverse for the role, ignoring nature.

This allowed me to break them all down the following way

Nature 1: Aggressive and Bossy
Nature 2: High energy/octane and confident
Nature 3: Seems to lack some focus (from note, can be serious or silly, depends on the role), supposed to be more... martial art focused
Nature 4: Should be people that are veterans, dealt with a lot of stuff
Nature 5: Seems to be protective of people, a weird proclivity for being straight to the point, supposed to be easygoing, laid back

Role 1: Thinks about ways to improve team (get in shape), hardworking and skilled
Role 2: Very much cocky, and aggressive/bossy
Role 3: Cares for team, Detailed, Smart/knowledgeable
Role 4: Confident, Protective
Role 5: Greed is key, just different kinds of greed
Role 6: Seen some stuff, and kinda broken in their own ways. Imagine the worst of each Nature.

Once broken down to the fundamental part of each nature/role, that allowed me to rebuild each personality into being unique and still accurate to the Nature/Role pairing it would become.

After discussing with SyKoHPaTH about a few of the personality names that needed refinement, we ended on this table of personalities

|          | Nature 1     | Nature 2    | Nature 3    | Nature 4     | Nature 5     |
| -------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Role 1   | Demanding    | Mouthpiece  | Sensei      | Veteran      | Seed sower   |
| Role 2   | Champ        | Energized   | Artist      | New Blood    | Activist     |
| Role 3   | Critical Eye | Hyperactive | Blockbuster | Professional | Caretaker    |
| Role 4   | Bullheaded   | Supportive  | Tea Drinker | Powerhouse   | Strongfast   |
| Role 5   | Impatient    | Speedrunner | Veil        | Mercenary    | Health Nut   |
| Role 6   | Arsonist     | Filterless  | Loner       | Old Gun      | Ecoterrorist |


There are also several unique personality types that I will be creating, and updating this list accordingly
Robot Catgirl (for R1L3Y waifu)
Almost Broken (for Trash-chan and potentially other almost broken waifus)
Antagonist (for Goddess of Dragons)
More to come, probably
