# Development-Repo

Welcome to Riley's Dev Repo!

Basically, going to be a whole ecosystem of my projects! Both the ones I work on my own, and the projects I help with!

Still a little new to Github, so this will also be the home of a lot of testing and hopefully, overtime, showcases how my skills have improved!

## Current Projects
Collaborate on a fellow Developer's project
 This repo will contain work I've created for said game, with the permission from the Developer to share names that they have created (credits in the folder with the work!)

## Future Projects
Build a large dataset to showcase skills in SQL, ETL Pipeline, Querying skills, 
 Attempt to also showcase ELT Pipeline

Build a website (Concept at least)

Find future projects specifically to hone C++, Java, and Python coding skills
